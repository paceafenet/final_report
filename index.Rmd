# Project Background

This contract was entered into in order to assist PEPFAR-supported countries to further advance and sustain access to quality-assured HIV laboratory services and bridge the gaps towards the 90-90-90
targets.

This agreement involves a number of organizations including the Institut de Recherche en Sante, de Surveillance Epidemiologique et de Formation/Cheikh Anta Diop University (IRESSEF/CADU), African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM), and Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), through a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 

# Project Tools

## Git

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a version control system for tracking changes made to files being worked on by multiple people. Git can be used for many purposes, however, for this project I used Git to update code used for this project and to document progress for accountability. Most of the guidance I used for this project came from a guidebook developed for using [R with Git](http://happygitwithr.com/). 

I downloaded [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and paired it with the project Gmail account using the guidebook referenced above.

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/about) is a popular repository cite for Git projects with both paid and free account options. There are many other competing repositories. I chose GitHub as it is a very easy to use repository and is very popular among the R user community. Additionally, GitHub has recently launched [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/), an easy to use tool to generate a web page from a GitHub repository. 

This report, as well as my weekly progress reports were produced using GitHub Pages.

## GitKraken

I find it easiest to think of a Git project as a folder directory composed of many files and folders which among other things can contain code. Pushing a Git project to GitHub is like making a copy of the folders that are on your local machine to an online repository using the same directory structure. 

Copying the folders to a repository after making changes is referred to as a "commit." It is possible to manage Git projects and make commits with shell commands. It is recommended in the user guide above that instead of using shell commands, project managers should use a product specifically for managing Git projects. [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/about) is one such product and was strongly recommended in the user guide above. I associated the project Gmail account with GitKraken, GitHub, and Git.

## R and Rstudio

All project analysis was done in [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), an open-sourced language for statistical computing using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/about/), the preferred IDE for programming in R. In this section I highlight important packages used for this project.

### Tidyverse

### R Markdown

### Radix

### Flexdashboard

### Shiny

### RODBC

The [RODBC](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RODBC/vignettes/RODBC.pdf) package provides a uniform interface for most popular database structures. SQL commands are sent to the database structure as strings as an argument in a function. 

A different function is used for each database structure. For example, the odbcConnect function can be used to connect to databases defined in your administrative tools settings. In the present work I used the odbcConnectAccess2007 function to interface the Microsoft Access databases used to store in-country data in Nigeria and Cameroon.   

### pdquickmap

There are a number of popular API's used to query mapping data including the Google Maps and MapQuest API. Because Google Maps recently changed their policy regarding their API and is requiring users submit a payment method before receiving an API key even if the number of requests sent to the API are under the payment threshold, I chose to find an API that does not require a payment method to generate an API key. 

The [pdquickmap](https://github.com/tarakc02/pdquickmap) package provides an interface for both the Google Maps and MapQuest API's. I setup a project account at the [MapQuest Developer](https://developer.mapquest.com/) using the project Gmail account.

### googlesheets

[googlesheets](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/googlesheets/vignettes/basic-usage.html) is a package developed by RStudio for accessing Google sheets. This package allows the user to read and write data stored in Google Sheets. Additionally, this package contains functions for authenticating your Google account within R.

### leaflet

[leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/) is a popular JavaScript library for developing interactive maps. The leaflet package developed is used to interface with this library using R. Leaflet provides basemap 'tiles' that can be used as base maps from map providers including Google Maps and Open Street Maps. 

### DT

The [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/) library provides an interface to the popular JavaScript DataTables library for making interactive tables in R. The primary function in this package is the datatables function which allows the developer to control conditional formatting of cells based on values in the table, finer control over column and cell size and formatting, the ability to add a search filter, and the ability to allow the user to edit the underlying data behind the table if desired. 

### Blastula

The [blastula](https://github.com/rich-iannone/blastula) can be used to create emails in R. Credentials can be passed to nearly any email service, and using popular services such as gmail is extremely easy to implement using this library. This library converts text, tables, and figures to html that can be passed to the chosen email service. We may or may not have used the functionality in this package for this project. However, I was asked it it were possible to schedule reports and notify partners to view the eTool, using a library such as blastula is necessary to do this without commercial software.
