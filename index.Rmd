# Project Background

This contract was entered into in order to assist PEPFAR-supported countries to further advance and sustain access to quality-assured HIV laboratory services and bridge the gaps towards the 90-90-90
targets.

This agreement involves a number of organizations including the Institut de Recherche en Sante, de Surveillance Epidemiologique et de Formation/Cheikh Anta Diop University (IRESSEF/CADU), African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM), and Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), through a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 

# Project Tools

## Git

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a version control system for tracking changes on files being worked on by multiple people. Git can be used for many purposes, however most of the guidance I used for this project came from a guidebook developed for using [R with Git](http://happygitwithr.com/). 

I downloaded Git [for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and paired it with the project gmail account using the instructions referenced above.
