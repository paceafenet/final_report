# Project Background

This contract was entered into in order to assist PEPFAR-supported countries to further advance and sustain access to quality-assured HIV laboratory services and bridge the gaps towards the 90-90-90
targets.

This agreement involves a number of organizations including the Institut de Recherche en Sante, de Surveillance Epidemiologique et de Formation/Cheikh Anta Diop University (IRESSEF/CADU), African Society for Laboratory Medicine (ASLM), and Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC), through a cooperative agreement with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 

# Project Tools

## Git

[Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) is a version control system for tracking changes made to files being worked on by multiple people. Git can be used for many purposes, however, for this project I used Git to update code used for this project and to document progress for accountability. Most of the guidance I used for this project came from a guidebook developed for using [R with Git](http://happygitwithr.com/). 

I downloaded [Git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org/) and paired it with the project Gmail account using the guidebook referenced above.

## GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/about) is a popular repository cite for Git projects with both paid and free account options. There are many other competing repositories. I chose GitHub as it is a very easy to use repository and is very popular among the R user community. Additionally, GitHub has recently launched [GitHub Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/what-is-github-pages/), an easy to use tool to generate a web page from a GitHub repository. 

This report, as well as my weekly progress reports were produced using GitHub Pages.

## GitKraken

I find it easiest to think of a Git project as a folder directory composed of many files and folders which among other things can contain code. Pushing a Git project to GitHub is like making a copy of the folders that are on your local machine to an online repository using the same directory structure. 

Copying the folders to a repository after making changes is referred to as a "commit." It is possible to manage Git projects and make commits with shell commands. It is recommended in the user guide above that instead of using shell commands, project managers should use a product specifically for managing Git projects. [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/about) is one such product and was strongly recommended in the user guide above. I associated the project Gmail account with GitKraken, GitHub, and Git.

## R and Rstudio

All project analysis was done in [R](https://www.r-project.org/about.html), an open-sourced language for statistical computing using [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/about/), the preferred IDE for programming in R. In this section I highlight important packages used for this project.
